			<strong>Command:</strong> MUL-Unsigned Multiplication of AL or AX<br>
			<strong>Arguments:</strong> DEST: any 8, 16 or 32 bit memory location or register<br>
			<strong>Usage:</strong> MUL DEST<br>
			<strong>Effects:</strong> MUL performs unsigned multiplication.

A byte operand is multiplied by AL; the result is left in AX. The carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if AH is 0; otherwise, they areset to 1.

A word operand is multiplied by AX; the result is left in DX:AX. DX contains the high-order 16 bits of the product. The carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if DX is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.

A doubleword operand is multiplied by EAX and the result is left in EDX:EAX. EDX contains the high-order 32 bits of the product. The carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if EDX is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.
